👋Hello! I am Canan ÖZTEKİN KAYNAR. I am a teacher who is passionate about software development, open to learning and always trying to improve. I like to produce innovative ideas, follow technological developments and include these developments in my projects.

💻 The education I received in computer science and the experience I gained in the software industry, where I worked part-time for 1 year, helped me solve problems with an analytical perspective and produce user-friendly solutions. I gained a wide range of knowledge and skills by working on different platforms and technologies.

👯 My self-confidence and self-learning curiosity contributed to my quick adaptation to new technologies and continuous development of my projects. At the same time, as someone who values teamwork, I take care to communicate effectively with team members in projects and enjoy celebrating successes together.

👩‍💻In In my free time, I follow technology blogs, contribute to open source projects, develop small projects to try new languages and technologies. I also enjoy outdoor activities such as nature walks and photography.

🙂 For me, software development is not only a profession, but also a passion and a lifestyle. I approach every project with excitement, contribute creative ideas and enjoy working collaboratively. I look forward to being part of a company that develops successful projects and grows with its teams. If I have the opportunity to work with you, you can be sure that I will do my best to move your company forward with my experience and skills.
